Organizing detail oriented competitor analysis, I worked with my team to create a dynamic user flow that solved this problem statement: Travelers need an app that simplifies trip planning, reduces expenses, and minimizes frustration by integrating reviews, lodging, transportation, transparency, food, and activities while avoiding hidden fees and overwhelming options. We were forced to work into a tight time window, since we had to do several iterations based on our user tests. This was a lot of learning.</div>

            The Solution:
Rev is a travel itinerary app that allows users to interact with other verified travelers and read reviews.
Our user tests revealed that the reviews were the part of the app that stood out most against our competitors such as Airbnb.</div>
